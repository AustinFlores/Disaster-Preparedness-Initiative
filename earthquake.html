        <h2>What is an Earthquake?</h2>
        <p>
            An <b>earthquake</b> is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. The
            surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. The location below the earth’s surface where the
            earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth
            is called the epicenter.

                <p>
                    The largest historical earthquake in the Philippines was the 1918 Celebes Sea earthquake, which
                    measured 8.3 on the moment magnitude scale (Mw). Other major earthquakes in the Philippines include:

                    <li><strong>1968 Casiguran Earthquake:</strong> This earthquake struck Casiguran, Aurora on August
                        2, 1968, and measured 7.3 on the moment magnitude scale. It killed 270 people and injured 261,
                        and caused millions of dollars in property damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>1976 Moro Gulf Earthquake:</strong> This earthquake measured 8.0 on the moment magnitude

                        Luzon on July 16, 1990, and measured 7.8 on the moment magnitude scale. It killed more than
                        1,200 people and caused P10 billion in infrastructure damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>2002 Mindanao Earthquake:</strong> This earthquake measured 7.5 on the moment magnitude

                    The Philippines is located where several tectonic plates interact, which can lead to major
                    earthquakes.

                <p>
                    Earthquakes are primarily caused by the movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth's surface. The
                    Earth's crust is divided into several large pieces, called tectonic plates, that float on the
                    semi-fluid layer of the mantle. These plates are constantly moving, but they often become stuck at
                    their edges due to friction. When the stress on the plates becomes too great, they suddenly slip or
                    rupture, releasing a massive amount of energy in the form of seismic waves, causing an earthquake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Earthquakes can also be caused by volcanic activity, where the movement of magma beneath the Earth's
                    crust generates pressure that causes the surrounding rocks to crack. Additionally, human activities
                    such as mining, reservoir-induced seismicity from large dams, and hydraulic fracturing (fracking)
                    can induce seismic events, though these are generally smaller than natural tectonic earthquakes.

                        <li>What causes earthquakes? - Earthquakes are primarily caused by the movement of tectonic
                            plates. They can also result from volcanic activity, landslides, or human activities.</li>
                        <li>What are tectonic plates? - Tectonic plates are large sections of the Earth’s crust that
                            move slowly over the mantle. Their interactions lead to seismic activity.</li>
                        <li>What are the different types of earthquakes? - Tectonic, Volcanic, Collapse, and Explosion
                            Earthquakes.</li>
                        <li>How is the magnitude of an earthquake measured? - Using the Richter scale or Moment
                            Magnitude Scale (Mw).</li>
                        <li>What is the difference between magnitude and intensity? - Magnitude measures energy;
                            intensity measures effects.</li>
                        <li>What are aftershocks? - Smaller quakes that follow the main earthquake.</li>
